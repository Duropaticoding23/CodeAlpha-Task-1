The Student Grade Tracker is a Java-based program designed to help teachers manage student grades. The program allows teachers to enter grades for each student, calculate average scores, and identify the highest and lowest scores.

# **Features:**

1. Student Management: Teachers can add students to the system and track their grades.
2. Grade Entry: Teachers can enter grades for each student, and the program will calculate the average score.
3. Average Score Calculation: The program calculates the average score for each student based on the entered grades.
4. Highest and Lowest Score Identification: The program identifies the highest and lowest scores for each student.
5. Grade Display: The program displays the average score, highest score, and lowest score for each student.

# **Usage:**

1. Run the program, and the main menu will appear.
2. Enter a student ID to add a new student or type 'exit' to finish.
3. For each student, enter grades one by one. Type 'done' to finish entering grades.
4. The program will display the average score, highest score, and lowest score for each student.

# **Example Use Case:**

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a student ID (e.g., "S123").
3. Enter grades for the student (e.g., 85, 90, 78).
4. Type 'done' to finish entering grades.
